        Myth: Cold weather and snow can kill the new coronavirus.
      </h4>
      <h4 className="fact">
        Fact: Cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the new coronavirus.
      </h4>
      <p>
        There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new
        coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body temperature remains
        around 36.5째C to 37째C, regardless of the external temperature or
        weather.
      </p>
      <h4 className="myth">
        Myth: COVID-19 virus will die and can't be transmitted in areas with hot
        and humid climates
      </h4>
      <h4 className="fact">
        Fact: COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid
        climates
      </h4>
      <p>
        From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL
        AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather. Regardless of
        climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, or travel to an area
        reporting COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is
        by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses
        that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then
        touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.
      </p>

      <h4 className="myth">
        Myth: Taking a hot bath to prevent and kill the new corona virus disease
        from our bodies
      </h4>
      <h4 className="fact">
        Fact: Taking a hot bath does not prevent the new coronavirus disease
      </h4>
      <p>
        Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your
        normal body temperature remains around 36.5째C to 37째C, regardless of the
        temperature of your bath or shower. Actually, taking a hot bath with
        extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you. The best way to
        protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands.
        By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid
        infection that coud occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.
      </p>

      <h4 className="myth">
        Myth: COVID-19 can be transmitted through mosquito bites.
      </h4>
      <h4 className="fact">
        Fact: COVID-19 CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites.
      </h4>
      <p>
        To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the
        new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus
        is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets
        generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets
        of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your
        hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap
        and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and
        sneezing.
      </p>

      <h4 className="myth">
        Myth: Hand dryers are effective in killing the new coronavirus
      </h4>
      <h4 className="fact">
        Fact: No. Hand dryers are NOT effective in killing the new coronavirus
      </h4>

      <h4 className="myth">
        Myth: Can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?
      </h4>
      <h4 className="fact">
        Fact: UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of
        skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation.
      </h4>

      <h4 className="myth">
        Myth: Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body can kill the new
        coronavirus
      </h4>
      <h4 className="fact">
        Fact: No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill
        viruses that have already entered your body.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes
        (i.e. eyes, mouth). Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be
        useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate
        recommendations.
      </p>

      <h4 className="myth">
        Myth: Vaccines against pneumonia are effective to protect you against
        the new coronavirus
      </h4>
      <h4 className="fact">
        Fact: No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and
        Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection
        against the new coronavirus.
      </h4>
      <p>
        The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine.
        Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO
        is supporting their efforts. Although these vaccines are not effective
        against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly
        recommended to protect your health.
      </p>

      <h4 className="myth">
        Myth: Regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection
        with the new coronavirus
      </h4>
      <h4 className="fact">
        Fact: No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with
        saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.
      </h4>
      <p>
        There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline
        can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However,
        regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory
        infections.
      </p>

      <h4 className="myth">
        Myth: Eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?
      </h4>
      <h4 className="fact">
        Fact: Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial
        properties.
      </h4>
      <p>
        However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating
        garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus.
      </p>

      <h4 className="myth">
        Myth: COVID affects older people, and not younger people?
      </h4>
      <h4 className="fact">
        Fact: People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus
        (2019-nCoV).
      </h4>
      <p>
        Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as
        asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to
        becoming severely ill with the virus. The WHO advises people of all ages
        to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by
        following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene.
      </p>

      <h4 className="myth">
        Myth: Antibiotics are effective in preventing and treating the new
        coronavirus
      </h4>
      <h4 className="fact">
        Fact: No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.
      </h4>
      <p>
        The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics
        should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive
        antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.
      </p>

      <h4 className="myth">
        Myth: Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new
        coronavirus?
      </h4>
      <h4 className="fact">
        Fact: To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or
        treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
      </h4>
      <p>
        However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care
        to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should
        receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under
        investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. The WHO is
        helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or
        partners.
